# War-Of-Ships
War-Of-Ships is a small game based on a well-known board game (Battleship) and applied to a graphical interface program.
This project will in August 2021 start  and will be completed by the end of October 2021.

# Programming language : C++(Use MFC_library)
language : Chinese(Traditional)

# Introduction
This is a complete Battleship mini game, which includes an introduction to the game and a perfect AI opponent.

# Inspiration
Since most of the previous programming was based on displaying the program results in the "editor" or "Cmd", this made me curious about how to implement a graphical interface program and apply it to practical applications so that it has certain functions.

# learning 
This project started with a zero foundation, so I used the holidays and after class to learn the architecture of MFC library and Win32 independently. I am very grateful for this series of Chinese tutorial videos. He clearly led the students to understand the source code infrastructure of the MFC library. And do it in practical applications.
