# War-Of-Ships
War-Of-Ships is a small game based on a well-known board game (Battleship) and applied to a graphical interface program.  
This project will in August 2021 start  and will be completed by the end of October 2021.  
  
Programming language : C++(Use MFC_library)  
language : Chinese(Traditional)  
  
Download program : https://drive.google.com/file/d/15S18m62IjkZXowLGFlmduSBOJViom6sp/view?usp=sharing  
  
# Introduction  
This is a complete Battleship mini game, which includes an introduction to the game and a perfect AI opponent.  
  
# Inspiration  
Since most of the previous programming was based on displaying the program results in the "editor" or "Cmd", this made me curious about how to implement a graphical interface program and apply it to practical applications so that it has certain functions.  
  
# learning 
This project started with a zero foundation, so I used the holidays and after class to learn the architecture of MFC library and Win32 independently.  
I am very grateful for this series of Chinese tutorial videos. He clearly led the students to understand the source code infrastructure of the MFC library. And do it in practical applications.
